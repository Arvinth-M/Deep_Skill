Understanding the Problem:

Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.
Data structures organize inventory data efficiently, enabling fast storage and retrieval. Algorithms define the operations for manipulating this data, ensuring quick additions, updates, deletions, and searches, which are crucial for large-scale inventory management efficiency and scalability.

Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
For efficient inventory management, especially with unique product IDs, a **Hash Map** is highly suitable due to its average $O(1)$ time complexity for add, update, and delete operations. A **Balanced Binary Search Tree** is also a good option if sorted traversal or range queries are frequently needed, offering $O(\log n)$ complexity.

Analysis (for HashMap based implementation):

Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.
Add: Average $O(1)$, worst-case $O(n)$ (rare, due to hash collisions).
Update: Average $O(1)$, worst-case $O(n)$ (rare, due to hash collisions).
Delete: Average $O(1)$, worst-case $O(n)$ (rare, due to hash collisions).
Traverse/List all: $O(n)$ as every item must be visited.

Discuss how you can optimize these operations.
Optimizations include ensuring a good hash function for the `HashMap` key for consistent $O(1)$ performance. For concurrent access, use `ConcurrentHashMap`. For searches by other attributes (e.g., product name), maintain secondary index data structures.
